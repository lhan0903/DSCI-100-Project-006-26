There are a number of different factors that are attributed to different species of iris flowers. Our multivariable dataset provides information on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, that we can use to predict the particular species of flower.

We want to predict the species of an iris flower given its:

- sepal length in centimeters
- sepal width in centimeters
- petal length in centimeters
- petal width in centimeters


We will be using the Iris data set found on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris. This set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a species of iris plant. The species are Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica
